Europa, pays, Europe, one ot' the four great continents into which the
world hasbeen divided. lt is situata between 36ο and 72⁰ ol north
latitude, and between 100 west and 650 east longitude. It extends
in length about 3300 miles, lrom the roclr of Lisbon in the west,
to the Uralian monntains in the east3 and in breadth about
2350 miles from the North Cape in Lapland to Cape Matapan,
the southern extremity ot* Graece. Though the smallest of the
four great divisione of the globe, it far surpasses thorn all in politi·
cal importance. Almost wholly situata within the temperate zone,
its climate is peculiarly lavorable to the physical and mental en-
ergias ol man3 while its numerous and extensive inland sous, fa·
cilitatingthe intercourse between its various natione, have pro·
moted their mutual progress in knowledge and civilization. Itis
here, accordingly, that the human mind has approached nearest
to perlection. lt ia hero that learning, seleuce, and the arts, have
been most successfully cultivated; that tho native freedom and
privileges of men have been most resolutely vindicated, and most
generally recognised, and that governments have been estab-
lished on the firm basis of mutual advantage to the rulers and
the ruled. In cornaquence ol those advantages Europe now gives
lawe to the greater partos the glohe; and seems destined to dif
fuse over all the other continents the light of knowledge, reline-
ment, and true religion. Iteancient divisione were Scandioooio,
