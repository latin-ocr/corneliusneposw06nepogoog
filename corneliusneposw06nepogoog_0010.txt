Bor little has been done to this edition save to add
Notos on the Lives from Epaminondas (XV), and
onwards. A Lexioon has also been added, whiohis
believed to be aoourate. A Historioal and Geographi·
oal Index completos the additions which hove been
made. It is proper to state that the editor of the first
edition'of this work is not responsible sor the addi·

tions now made. They have been added owing to the
pressing desire os teaehers to possess the complete·
work. These additions will be found to be improve-
ment, and serve to render the work as nearly perfeot
as the plan submitted permitted.
