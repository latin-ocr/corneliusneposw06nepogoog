The disgrace of this [man’s] early manhood· was blot·
ted out by his very great exertions.²—l doubt not that he
will give himself up entirely to literature.⁸-His mother
was of a noble family—Themistocles, having squander·
ed his fortune, was disinhe'rited by his father—Nor did
he judge less accurately of [what] was present than he
conjectured ably of [what was still] future-Themisto·
cles is going to appear [as an orator] before the assem·
bly of the people.-Themistocles‚ having blotted-out that
disgrace by the greatest exertions‚² became distinguished
in a short time.
