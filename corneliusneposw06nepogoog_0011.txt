PREFAGF.

a-

'l'nn English edition of this little work was accom·
panied by 'the following brief announcement:

“ Should the plan and execution of this little volume
meet with the approbetion of able rnstructors, it will
probably be followed by a similar one on selected por-
tions of Xenophon's works.

“For the answcrs to the questions 1 am principally
indebted to the excellent editions of Cornelius Nepos
by Bremi, Datne, and Jaumanrt.

“emancupare Τ· Κ· Α·”

ln this American edition the alterations will be found
to eonsist principally in a more full and correct citation
of illustrative passages, in frequent references to the
recent reprint of Zumpt’s Latin Grammar, to confirm
or silently modify the positions tehen, andin the addi-

' tion of thet no tes at the foot of the page, which are re·

ferred to by letters of the alphabet.

Many other changes have been made m the correo·
tion of errors, which appear to have been the conse·
quence of haste, of which it is hoped this edition will
be comparatively free.

With these brief statements of what the editor is
responsible for, he leaves this little volume to win for
itself, both with toachers and pupils, the favor which
it deserves. E A J
