Iphicrates was so great a general, that he never lest
a battle by any fault of his own. Is any general of
earlier times to be preferred to Iphicrates? Iphicrates
is said never to have lost a battle by his ewn fault.
Iphicrates enriched the art os war by many new inven-
tiens and many improvements. Though we diminish
the weight [of their armer], their persons will be equally
well defended, and the soldiers themselves will be able
te meve and charge with greater activity.
