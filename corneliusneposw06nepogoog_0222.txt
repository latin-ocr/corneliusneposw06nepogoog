EXERCISE.

I doubt whether fortime has aot more power in' thie

matter, than the ability of the general. Of his friends

some were banished, others executed. I doubt whether Δ

they are not going to confiscate their property, and di·

vide it among themselves. These things are common
to Alcibiades and Thrasybulus. I doubt whether he is

going to proclaim war against the king. lt was the
good fortune of Thrasybulus to be, not only the first,
but the only person, who freed Athens from her most
detestable tyrants. Alcibiades, by a sort of natural tact,

made it appear, that it was he alone, who had eet his
country free.
