The easiest way to become free from the dominion of
the Persians will beto break down the bridge, which
Darius has made over the river Danube-Histiaeus of
Miletus opposed the breaking down of the bridge.—Thc
same thing is not expedient to us, who hold sovereign
power, and to the multitude-I will prevent the advice
of· Miltiades from coming to the king's ears-I don’t .
doubt that our'sovereignty depende on Dariue’s remain-
ing king.¹-I don’t doubt but that you will be deprived
of your power, and punished by your follow-citizens.-
Not the kingdom oi Darius only, but our own sovereignty
will be extinguished.-Histiaeus of Miletus prevented
the opinion of Miltiades from prevailing.
