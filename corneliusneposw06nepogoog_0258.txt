Artaxerxes does not blame himself, dut sends lum ·
written dIrections [to leave] this great war [and] pro·
coed to an inconsiderable affair. How few there are
[Pr. lntr. 477] who if any mischance happens, blame ’
themselves! Datames drew upon himself the enmity
of the courtiers the more, because the king had ordered
that he should share the command [chap. 3, end] with
Pharnabazus. You will be in great danger, if any thing
goes wrong in Egypt, while you have the command.
There is no doubt that you will have for your bitterest
enemy the man, whose advice the king principally fol-
lows. Written orders were sent him by the king, to
march into Cilicia with not very numerous forces.
Nothing shall hinder me from preparing the Egyptians
to resIst.
